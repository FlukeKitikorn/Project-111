## General info
The Stock Management project is a system created to manage and control inventory in various businesses.
In this project, the system will provide functionality for:
* Recording Product Data: Users can input and store information about products, such as the product name, company name, price, quantity, etc.
* Modifying or Deleting Data: Users can modify or delete existing product data as needed. This allows for updating product details or removing outdated entries.
* Storing Data in a Text File: The product data will be saved and stored in a text file, such as "text.txt". This allows for persistent storage and easy retrieval of the data.
* Calculating Bills: The system will process the data in the text file to calculate bills for each company based on the products and quantities purchased.
* Displaying Results: The calculated bills for each company will be displayed to the user. This provides an overview of the financial transactions and helps with managing the billing process.

Overall, the project aims to create a stock management system that efficiently manages product data, supports data modification and deletion, stores data in a text file format, and calculates bills based on the stored information. The system allows for better control and organization of inventory, as well as streamlining billing processes for businesses or organizations.
